# Redis config YAML
# This config file is copied from Scylla [https://github.com/scylladb/scylla], and modified by Pedis. 
#
#######################################
# This file is split to two sections:
# 1. Supported parameters
# 2. Unsupported parameters: reserved for future use or backwards
#    compatibility.
# Scylla will only read and use the first segment
#######################################

### Supported Parameters

# The name of the cluster. This is mainly used to prevent machines in
# one logical cluster from joining another.
cluster_name: 'Test'

# This defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring
# The more tokens, relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data
# that this node will store. You probably want all nodes to have the same number
# of tokens assuming they have equal hardware capability.
#
# If you already have a cluster with 1 token per node, and wish to migrate to 
# multiple tokens per node, see http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations
num_tokens: 256

# Directory where Scylla should store data on disk.
# If not set, the default directory is $CASSANDRA_HOME/data/data.
data_file_directories:
    - ${REDIS_HOME}/data

# commit log.  when running on magnetic HDD, this should be a
# separate spindle than the data directories.
# If not set, the default directory is $CASSANDRA_HOME/data/commitlog.
commitlog_directory: ${REDIS_HOME}/commitlog

# commitlog_sync may be either "periodic" or "batch."
#
# the other option is "periodic" where writes may be acked immediately
# and the CommitLog is simply synced every commitlog_sync_period_in_ms
# milliseconds.
commitlog_sync: periodic
commitlog_sync_period_in_ms: 10000

# The size of the individual commitlog file segments.  A commitlog
# segment may be archived, deleted, or recycled once all the data
# in it (potentially from each columnfamily in the system) has been
# flushed to sstables.
#
# The default size is 32, which is almost always fine, but if you are
# archiving commitlog segments (see commitlog_archiving.properties),
# then you probably want a finer granularity of archiving; 8 or 16 MB
# is reasonable.
commitlog_segment_size_in_mb: 32

# seeds address are mandatory!
seeds: "127.0.0.1"

# Address or interface to bind to and tell other Scylla nodes to connect to.
# You _must_ change this if you want multiple nodes to be able to communicate!
#
# Setting listen_address to 0.0.0.0 is always wrong.
listen_address: localhost

# Address to broadcast to other Scylla nodes
# Leaving this blank will set it to the same value as listen_address
# broadcast_address: 1.2.3.4

# port for the CQL native transport to listen for clients on
# For security reasons, you should not expose this port to the internet.  Firewall it if needed.
service_port: 6379 

# Throttles all outbound streaming file transfers on this node to the
# given total throughput in Mbps. This is necessary because Scylla does
# mostly sequential IO when streaming data during bootstrap or repair, which
# can lead to saturating the network connection and degrading rpc performance.
# When unset, the default is 200 Mbps or 25 MB/s.
# stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec: 200

# How long the coordinator should wait for read operations to complete
read_request_timeout_in_ms: 5000

# How long the coordinator should wait for writes to complete
write_request_timeout_in_ms: 2000

# phi value that must be reached for a host to be marked down.
# most users should never need to adjust this.
# phi_convict_threshold: 8

# port for REST API server
api_port: 10000

# IP for the REST API server
api_address: 127.0.0.1

# Log WARN on any batch size exceeding this value. 5kb per batch by default.
# Caution should be taken on increasing the size of this threshold as it can lead to node instability.
batch_size_warn_threshold_in_kb: 5

# A value of -1 (default) will automatically equate it to the total amount of memory
# available for Scylla.
commitlog_total_space_in_mb: -1
